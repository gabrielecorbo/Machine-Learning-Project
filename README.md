## Description

In this report is described the framework we followed to develop an ML model
that uses **Photovoltaic system** power output to detect malfunctions. Using binary
classification, we have separated faulty system conditions from healthy system
conditions. With multiclass classification, it is possible to determine the type of fault
that is causing a system to malfunction. Additionally, the different meteorological
conditions like incident solar irradiance, sun position and ambient temperature can
be utilized to learn complex relations between these features. Another aspect which
plays a role is system age, as different fault types are more likely to occur at specific
moments of the systemâ€™s lifetime. We approached the tasks by implementing many
models of ascending complexity in order to find the most accurate one and then
tested it to determine its goodness.

## Output
